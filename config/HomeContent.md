# Accessibility Hackathon

### Welcome to the multiwide discord server hackathon, sponsored by Devcord! 

The goal of this hackathon is to teach new developers to learn how to code and design accessible websites. 
From something as small as adding a title attribute to an image to building a complete full-stack web-accessible application, 
we want everyone to be able to participate.


### When will it take place?

It will start on the 10th of December and end on the 24th of December. A panel of judges will be appointed to decide the winners  who will be announced on the 1st of February, 2020.

### What is web accessibility?

Some examples are people using smartphones, smart TVs, devices with different input modes, or those using slow internet connections or situational limitations.

Web accessibility depends on several components working together, including web technologies, web browsers, authoring tools, and websites.
